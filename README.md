Project Title: Blood Bank Management System

Project Description:

The Blood Bank Management System is a comprehensive software solution developed using Java Swing for the user interface and MySQL for database management. This system is designed to streamline the process of blood donation and request management, making it easier for donors, seekers, hospitals, and blood banks to efficiently connect and fulfill their blood-related needs.

User Authentication and Registration:
Users, including donors, seekers, hospitals, and blood banks, must create an account with unique login credentials.
Users can update their passwords and personal information as needed.

Donor Module:
Donors can register themselves and provide their personal details, including blood type, contact information, and location.
Donors can view all available blood banks in their city, making it easier for them to donate blood.
Donors can check their donation history

Seeker Module:
Seekers can register and provide their personal details, including blood type and contact information.
Seekers can search for nearby blood banks and view their contact information and available blood types.
Seekers can send blood requests to nearby blood banks, specifying the required blood type and urgency.

Hospital Module:
Hospitals can register and provide their details, including location, contact information, and available blood types.
Hospitals can manage their blood inventory and update it in real-time.
Hospitals can respond to blood requests from seekers, confirming or denying the availability of the requested blood type.
Hospitals can view donor information and contact donors for potential blood donations.

Blood Bank Module:
Blood banks can register and provide their details, including location, contact information, and available blood types.
Blood banks can manage their blood inventory, including incoming and outgoing stock.
Blood banks can schedule and organize blood donation camps.
Blood banks can respond to blood requests from seekers, confirming or denying the availability of the requested blood type.

The Blood Bank Management System aims to bridge the gap between blood donors, seekers, hospitals, and blood banks, facilitating efficient and timely blood donation and request processes. It promotes transparency, accessibility, and accountability in the management of blood-related activities, ultimately contributing to saving lives and ensuring the availability of blood when needed.
